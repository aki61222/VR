	<h1>BRIEF HISTORY OF VIRTUAL REALITY</h1>
	
   <p> The phrase "virtual reality" originally appeared in the mid-1980s, when Lanier, founder of VPL Research, began developing the equipment (goggles and gloves) required to experience what he coined "virtual reality."
   However, even before then, technologists were creating simulated worlds. The Sensorama in 1956 was a pivotal event. Morton Heilig had a history in the Hollywood cinematic universe. He was curious as to how individuals might feel as if they were "in" the movie.  The experience replicated a real-world metropolitan setting, through which you "rode" on a motorbike. Multisensory stimulation let you see the road, hear the engine, feel the vibration, and smell the motor’s exhaust in the designed “world.”</p>

   <p> The phrase "Virtual Reality" is an open compound word/noun derived from its component terms 'virtual' and'reality.'
       The definition of 'virtual' is "almost or nearly as stated, but not entirely or according to precise definition." - From the Oxford English Dictionary.
       'Reality,' on the other hand, is described as "the condition of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealised or conceptual understanding of them."
       Alternatively, "anything that is genuinely experienced or seen, especially when it is unpleasant." - From the Oxford English Dictionary.</p>

   <p> "Virtual reality is the term used to describe a three-dimensional, computer-generated environment which can be explored and interacted with by a person. That person becomes part of this virtual world or is immersed within this environment and whilst there, is able to manipulate objects or perform a series of actions." - 'Virtual Reality' Society. </p>

   <p> Ivan Sutherland ("The Father of Graphics") created his "Ultimate Display" concept in 1965, with the goal of potentially replicating reality to the point that you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. He imagined a virtual environment viewed through an HMD, complete with 3D audio and haptic input.
   It was also to be linked to a computer, which would generate the simulation in real time and allow the user to interact with things in a realistic manner.
   This intended to serve as the model for future VR innovations in the pipeline.
   For many VR fanatics, Ivan's "Sword of Damocles" was the initial introduction to VR (and the first 'Virtual Reality' headgear). This was created with the assistance of his student Bob Sproull and comprised of an HMD linked to a computer (not a camera).

   This apparatus was cumbersome, uncomfortable, and needed to be hanging from the ceiling (hence the name). Users were strapped in and showed extremely basic computer-generated images of items in wireframe rooms.</p>

   <p> VPL Research developed the first official VR products: the EyePhone (yes), the DataGlove, and the DataSuit. They provided a fascinating, though graphically rudimentary, experience, but they were sluggish, uncomfortable, and prohibitively costly, costing more than $350,000 for a full system for two people, including the computer to power it all.

   Nonetheless, VR caught the popular imagination in the early half of the 1990s, propelled by VPL's promise and fueled by sci-fi writers. If you haven't read Neal Stephenson's 1992 novel Snow Crash, you may have watched the film Lawnmower Man, which was released the same year and featured VPL's gear (and was so far removed from the Stephen King short story it purported to adapt that King sued to have his name removed from the poster). It wasn't just in genre films and speculative fiction that VR made an appearance: it was also in syndicated live-action kiddie shows like VR Troopers, as well as episodes of Murder She Wrote and Mad About You.</p>

  <p>
  In 2012, id Software cofounder and virtual-reality aficionado, John Carmack, came to the E3 videogame trade show with a special surprise: He had borrowed a prototype of a headset created by a 19-year-old VR enthusiast named Palmer Luckey and hacked it to run a VR version of the game Doom. Its face was covered with duct tape, and a strap ripped from a pair of Oakley ski goggles was all that held it to your head, but it worked. When people put on the headset, they found themselves surrounded by the 3D graphics they'd normally see on a TV or monitor. They weren't just playing Doom—they were inside it.</p>
