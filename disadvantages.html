	<h1>Disadvantages</h1>
	<p>1.Expensive: Along with high-definition features it also has a high price. Because of this, not everyone can use it.</p>
    <p>2.Physical effects: Due to the gear and rays some people could experience their eyes straining or headache. It could also result in motion sickness depending on what you are viewing. </p>
    <p>3.Addictive: Just like any other technology, even VR can become addictive. Users can be so enthralled in that that they could forget the real world.</p>
    <p>4.Training through VR: One thing all must understand is that no matter how much ever feeling of reality VR might give, it is not the real world.
    Trainings done through VR could be helpful but they cannot guarantee success in real situations.</p>
