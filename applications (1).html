	<h1>Applications of Virtual Reality</h1>
    <ol>
 <p>    <li>VR in Military <br>
      The military in the UK and the US have both adopted the use of virtual reality in their training as it allows them to undertake a huge range of simulations.The military uses it for flight simulations, battlefield simulations, medic training, vehicle simulation and virtual boot camp, among other things. VR is a completely immersive, visual and sound-based experience, which can safely replicate dangerous training situations to prepare and train soldiers, without putting them at risk until they are ready for combat.</li> </p>

<p>
      <li>VR in Sports <br>
      Previously, sports could only be seen from the stadium. It eventually made its way into our houses' electronic screens. People can now not only watch their favourite sporting events on their displays, but they can also select from a variety of camera angles and views for a more immersive experience.

      Virtual reality is going above and beyond just fine-tuning today's sports. It also serves as the basis and building block for an entirely new category of sports - Virtual Reality (VR) sports!

      VR sports are the ideal synthesis of fantasy video games and real-world sports. Imagine being able to compete in a football competition with the world's greatest players while having no professional experience! It may sound crazy, but Virtual Reality has you covered!</li> </p>

<p>
      <li>VR in Mental Health <br>
      According to the World Health Organization, one in every four persons may have mental or neurological problems at some time in their lives. Approximately 450 million individuals are now affected by such diseases.

      Given that mental illnesses are among the main causes of illness and disability worldwide, VR is a welcome addition to therapy options. VR has already been demonstrated in studies to alleviate specific phobias, cure PTSD, assist patients with psychotic illnesses experience less paranoia and anxiety in public, and lessen social anxiety.

      Due to expense and technological constraints, VR has not been extensively used as a treatment to far. However, with the increasing availability of low-cost standalone and mobile VR headsets, there is a greater possibility to utilise VR to decentralise mental health therapy, allowing more individuals to benefit.

      An early study launched by Bravemind researchers aimed at assisting returning soldiers in processing and dealing with combat trauma. Patients were equipped with a head-mounted display and virtually returned to Fallujah or other combat zones in the Middle East. The troops held a rifle or other weapon and were subjected to a simulation that includes booming explosions, rumbling motors, and even smoke and dust being vented into the therapy area.

      Bravemind is seen as a success, and it has been used as part of psychotherapy programmes to assist veterans in processing their experiences, reducing panic attacks, and even sleeping without medication, sometimes for the first time in years.</li> </p>

      <li>VR in Medical Training<br>
      In medical school, most medical students endure hours of rigorous hands-on training. Typically, they train with cadavers, mannequins, training software, and other hands-on devices. Although these tools have trained excellent doctors for years, virtual reality training replicates the real world like never before. VR training has become so advanced, that there are several medical schools that have introduced it into their medical training curriculum.
      Here are some ways:
      <ul>
      <li>Surgery simulation:<br>
      Simulation of an operating room environment. Helps surgeons gain practical skills and raise competence levels in safe environment.</li>

      <li>Crisis simulation:<br>
      Simulation of rare emergencies, accidents with multiple casualties, or disease outbreaks. Allows medical experts to develop automatic response behavior to low-frequency situations.</li>

      <li>Onboarding:<br>
      Simulation of typical work environment for starting-out medical professionals. Helps to faster adjust to real job specifics and eliminates skill deficiency in risk-free conditions.</li>

      <li>Use of medical equipment:<br>
      Simulation of operating professional medical equipment. Minimizes training costs due to trainer-less guidance and lowers the learning curve.</li>
